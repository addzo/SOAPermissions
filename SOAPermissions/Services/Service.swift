 Implementing Separation of Concerns therough services in Swift
 This approach uses absctract functional interfaces and dependency injection to separate the logic from the user layer.
 The Protocol defines an interface but nothing about the implementation.  Thia makes it easier to provide multiple
 implementations of functionalities, including mocking services for testing.
 All of this means that the class(es) using the service never has to change with the different implementations.
 To use the services they have to be "registered".  The registry is a central place where the code can get the services
 that are available.  The registry can be extended for difference service implementations as well - it can return specific
 or groups of services.  After that, the services can be injected into the code base directly e.g.
 PermissionsViewController(permissionsService).
 Here the registry  is a kind of Service Locator Pattern I believe.
 
 Lazy Instantiation
 In Swift we can lazily instantiate a service the same as any other object.  We can set up the lazy instantiation with a
 closure that is difered until the service is first invoked.  When it is the closure will instantiate it, and return it
 to the caller.

    // Default implementation for a sdervice to register itself

        ServiceRegistry.add(service: self)
